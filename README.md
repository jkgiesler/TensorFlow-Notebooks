# Misc Tensorflow Notebooks

### Classic dog vs cat kaggle experiment
Refreshing my memory of the standard keras pipeline. It looks like they've made improvements to generating data on CPU while GPU is training.

### TensorBoard data in jupyter
Pull in data from the TensorBoard server to a DataFrame for nice visualization in a jupyter notebook.

### DCGAN baroque
Trying to use DCGAN/InfoGAN to learn baroque style paintings. Possibly this will turn into something like [iGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/iGAN)
